# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why don't you keep documentation on another site?

Though many Skript-specific documentation sites have popped up and grown in popularity, these sites typically have two issues that make them an unattractive option for skript-mirror.

* Documentation is usually stored solely by the site. If the site ever breaks or shuts down, this means the documentation may be lost as well.   Currently, documentation is stored on Github and Gitbook. These sites are unlikely to shutdown or suffer outages, and backups of the documentation are stored in skript-mirror's git repository. 
* These sites lack the flexibility of other documentation solutions. Generally, these sites focus on documenting each feature individually. While this might be adequate for many simpler Skript addons, skript-mirror's complexity necessitates the use of manually organized documentation.

That being said, third-party sites may display the contents of skript-mirror's documentation, but they would be responsible for keeping the documentation up-to-date. For the convenience of other scripters, these sites should prominently display [a link to the original documentation](https://skript-mirror.gitbook.io/docs/) on each page. Please avoid documenting features individually or using an automated tool to extract syntax patterns from skript-mirror. Most of skript-mirror's core features are best explained using hand-written documentation.
